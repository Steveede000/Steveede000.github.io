                    <p class="description">Continuing my enjoyment of creativity, I like to create solutions to problems I create. This is a wallpaper I made in Krita, the sole reason I made this is because I couldn't find a wallpaper of its nature in a high enough resolution and color scheme. So I did it myself.</p>

                    <p class="description">I have never owned a pre-build computer, except for laptops of course. I have only ever built my own desktop computers. I don't think there is anything wrong with prebuilds, but I enjoy the build process and nerding out over specs, so I'll continue building PC's in the future.</p>
