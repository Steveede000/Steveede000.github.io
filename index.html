            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Eden. I am a cybersecurity major at Green River College. I have experience working in programs such as Blender, Photoshop, and Krita on the creative side and Microsoft 365, Github, and Azure for productivity. This website is a small collection of projects I have worked/am working on. I hope you find these projects of mine as interesting as I found them fun to do. </p>

                    <p class="description">Continuing on my affinity to creativity, I like to create solutions to problems I create. This is a wallpaper I made in Krita, the sole reason I made this is because I couldn't find a wallpaper of its nature in a high enough resolution and color scheme. So I did it myself.</p>
